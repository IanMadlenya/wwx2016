# WWX2016
Hello haxers, here is the spot to help us organize the WWX2016

## Contributing

We'll put here all the communication materials we'll use for this year WWX. Feel free to improve them or create new ones by making pull requests!

If you're not into design/communication/development, go see the lastest [issues](https://github.com/silexlabs/wwx2016/issues) to submit your ideas and discuss other's.

It's important for us that you feel free to improve WWX. That's why if an idea has a great number of supporters and is realisable (in time and budget), we'll do everything to make it happen in total transparency.

Don't wait anymore, help WWX2016 kicks WWX2015's ass!
