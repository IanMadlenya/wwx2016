# WWX2016
Hello haxers, here is the spot to help us organize the WWX2016

## Contributing
We'll put here all the communication materials we'll use for this year WWX. Feel free to improve them or create new one by making pull request!

It's important for us that you feel free to improve WWX. That's why if an idea has a great number of supporters and is realisable (in time and budget), we'll make everything to make it happen in total transparency.
