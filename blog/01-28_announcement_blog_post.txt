Continuing on the spirit of not changing what's not broken we'll also do
a crowd-funding campaign this year, which should launch by the end of February,
giving you the opportunity to register.
Although it's not the exact same, we've simplified the rewards ;)
We'll give you more details soon and we'll be counting on you to help us
spread the word about it!

In the meantime we are already looking for speakers to do talks, lightning
talks or workshops. If you're interested in doing one submit your idea by
opening an issue on https://github.com/silexlabs/wwx2016.
If you have an idea that you would like to listen to/participate feel
free to open an issue too.

This Github repository is the one place where the entire organization
is centralized in a free and open source manner. In it you'll be able to
find every communication materials, every decisions and every tasks
discussed publicly.
Feel free to improve them or contribute new ones, create press releases
and helping us getting things done!
It's important for us that you feel free to improve WWX. That's why if an
idea has a great number of supporters and is realizable (in time and budget),
we'll do everything to make it happen in total transparency.

If you wish to sponsor this great event contact us at contact@silexlabs.org.

This is already the 6th WWX, let's make it the best WWX yet,
hope to see you soon in Paris!

Best,
The Thaxe Force Team
